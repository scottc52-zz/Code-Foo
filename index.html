		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
	Hi! My name is Scott Chung. I'm a senior college student majoring in mechanical engineering and computer science. I started my second major in computer science in my junior year. Last summer, I tried very hard to find a computer science internship but found that I had to compete with other students who had focused primarily on CS and had more experience. I'm hoping that you guys will take a chance on me. I would love to have the opportunity to work at IGN, and I'm eager to prove what I'm capable of.<br /><br />
	To tell you a little more about me, I LOVE film and television! In fact, I spent two years working as an editor at the online TV Station for my university. This also means that I watch way too much TV for my own good.<br /><br />
	I also love games (who doesn't?). I actually grew up playing Duckhunt and the original Super Mario Bros. for Nes with my dad and my sister when I was a wee little toddler. And of course, I got into Pokemon and Final Fantasy and a myriad of other games as I grew up. I'm a big fan of racing games and side scrollers. I've never really gotten into first person shooters, unlike most of my friends, but hey, different strokes for different folks, right? <br /><br />
	Getting back to the point here: I would be downright honored if I got to work with you guys. And I really, really hope you guys pick me to be in Code-Foo! Thank you.
